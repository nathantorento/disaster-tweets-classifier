    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This paper will be based on the Kaggle competition Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started). It's an introductory challenge to serve as practice for Natural Language Processing with focus on Text Classification. The competition creators gathered 10875  tweets that are reporting an emergency or some man-made/natural disaster – the selection process is left unspecified. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "There are three provided files:\n",
    "- train.csv - the training set\n",
    "- test.csv - the test set\n",
    "- sample_submission.csv - the framework for official competition submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset contains these columns:\n",
    "- id: a unique numeric identifier for each tweet\n",
    "- text: the actual content in the tweet\n",
    "- keyword: keywords from the tweet manually selected by the competition creators (may be blank)\n",
    "- location: the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)\n",
    "- target: values are hand classified by creators as either 0 for non-disaster or 1 for disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is similar to the training data set except for not having a target column.\n",
    "The sample_submission contains the id and a target column for all the tweets that competitors will have to populate with their proposed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "The challenge of the competition is to create a model that can most accurately predict the test set and achieve a high F1 Score (read more at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our team, however, we're hoping to use this challenge as our final academic opportunity to apply as many of the skills we've learned in our Practical Data Science Tutorial while exploring additional Data Science fields and methods we're interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we decided to create an NLP pipeline for this challenge, split it into four parts, and self-allocate as you will see in the Team Roles section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note: We all worked on different sections of a pipeline, and those sections naturally vary in magnitude of required effort. Thus, while we consolidated efforts to create output that fed or flowed into each other's section, we each individually explored into aspects of the data or task that were not necessary for the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Roles\n",
    "- Wei-Ting Yap: data exploration and pre-processing\n",
    "- Emma Stiefel: data pre-processing and completion of data\n",
    "- Nathan Torento (me): model creation and comparison\n",
    "- Henry Biko: model evaluation"

    "# Data exploration and pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore and pre-process the training dataset, Wei-Ting chose to use the open-source NLP library for Python called spaCy. It is a level up from the NLTK library in that it is object oriented rather than string processing, computationally faster, and provides more customizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an infinite permutation of implementations to preprocess text. Wei-Ting chose to pre-process the tweets such that for every tweet, she would take these steps:\n",
    "- identify all # (hashtags)\n",
    "- identify all @ (Twitter account mentions in-tweet)\n",
    "- identify all URLs\n",
    "- lowercase\n",
    "- tokenize\n",
    "- lemmatize\n",
    "- remove stopwords\n",
    "- bag of words\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all standard NLP pre-processing steps, except Wei-Ting also considers the format and context of tweets by distinguishing the non-plain text that are likely to appear as well. Thus, she creates a Bag of Words for each row that counts the instances of text starting with #, text starting with @, URLs, and all lemmatize non-stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For good measure, I would also remove emojis by searching and deleting all instances of their unicodes with regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her final output, however, implements \"count vectorization\" - an extension on the Bag of Words (BoW) concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Count Vectorization\n",
    "After creating a bag of words for every tweet, every \"word\" (or string) that has ever appeared is now added as a separate column of the dataset. Every row then places the number of times the strings in its lemmatized, non-stopword, bag of words appear for each column. This is a lengthy process to run on nearly 6000 tweets as it results in >20000 columns and a >200 mb dataset, so Wei-Ting saved the pre-processed .csv for easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My only qualm with this manual count vectorization is that it scales the dataset dimensions and size exponentially, making it more computationally costly and timely to load and use the dataset. It took me nearly 10 minutes to load the training data each runtime. Thus, for the model section later, I slightly modify Wei-Ting's code."

    "# Data pre-processing and completion of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Emma decided to take on the challenge of completely filling in the \"location\" section, as well as further spell-checking the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "Emma used the Mordecai library, which uses spaCy, Geonames, and the TensorFlow interact keras, to \"Geoparse\" the tweets. The library is often used to parse through text, identify information about geographical locations, then return these locations' coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Although not necessary for the tweet disaster classification pipeline, in real life, location is crucial information for emergency response and disaster response planning."

    "In real life, CNNs are often used for the task of text classification so long as the corpus is converted into some standardized vector of numbers. Without knowing this, I chose to use a convolutional neural networks because they are a popular go-to method for prediction problems, and they work well with image data-like input. Given that we applied the count vectorizer function on our data to produce a matrix of 0-1 values much like an image, a CNN is appropriate here. \n",
